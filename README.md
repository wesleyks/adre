# Adre - ADR Extended

## Usage

```bash
brew install adre

adre init
adre new "Babby's first ADR"
adre serve
```

## Constraints

- user only needs to instal adre and nothing else
- easy to use
- support migrate off adr-tools
- mostly compatible with adr-tools
- minimal dependencies
- adrs read well like a regular document (im looking at you, yaml frontmatter)
